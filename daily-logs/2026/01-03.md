## 🧠 Key Notes

## 1️⃣ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- A VPC is a **logically isolated private network** in AWS
- You define the **IP address range (CIDR)** (e.g. `10.0.0.0/16`)
- A VPC belongs to **one AWS Region**
- Can span **multiple Availability Zones**
- Used to launch AWS resources like EC2, RDS, Load Balancers

### Security in VPC
- Security Groups (instance-level)
- Network ACLs (subnet-level)

### Important
- Default VPC exists in every region
- Custom VPC provides full control and is preferred for production

---

## 2️⃣ Subnets

- A subnet is a **division of a VPC’s IP range**
- Each subnet belongs to **one Availability Zone**
- Subnets help organize resources by security and availability
- Each subnet must be associated with a **route table**

### Types of Subnets
**Public Subnet**
- Route to Internet Gateway
- Used for web servers, bastion hosts

**Private Subnet**
- No direct internet access
- Used for databases and backend services

---

## 3️⃣ Route Tables

- Route tables control **traffic flow within a VPC**
- Contain rules with destination CIDR and target
- Every subnet must have **one route table**

### Common Routes
- `10.0.0.0/16 → local` (internal VPC traffic)
- `0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway` (internet access)

### Important
- Public or private subnet is decided by the route table
- Main route table is used by default

---

## 4️⃣ Security Groups

- Security Groups act as **virtual firewalls**
- Applied at **EC2 / ENI level**
- Control inbound and outbound traffic

### Key Characteristics
- **Stateful**
- Only **ALLOW rules**
- Can reference other security groups

### Best Practice
- Separate security groups for web, app, and database layers

---

## 5️⃣ Internet Gateway (IGW)

- Enables **communication between VPC and the internet**
- Attached at the **VPC level**
- Required for public internet access

### To Make EC2 Public
1. Attach Internet Gateway to VPC
2. Add route `0.0.0.0/0 → IGW`
3. Launch EC2 in public subnet
4. Assign public IP
5. Allow traffic in Security Group

## 🔑 Quick Summary

- VPC → Private AWS network
- Subnet → AZ-specific network segment
- Route Table → Traffic routing rules
- Security Group → Stateful instance firewall
- Internet Gateway → Internet access for VPC
